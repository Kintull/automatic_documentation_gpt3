# AuDoc

Goal of this project is to make automated documentation builder and human friendly search in a large code base.



Parts:
  * Documentation builder - uses GPT-3 to generate module documentation.
  * Runtime - web application that displays documentation in a file tree view.
  * Search engine - utilizes GPT-3 to search in generated documentation.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
